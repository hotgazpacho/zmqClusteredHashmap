# zmqClusteredHashmap
An implementation in C# of the ⌀mq [Clustered Hashmap Protocol](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:12) server and client for reliable messaging.

This implementation uses the [clrzmq2](https://github.com/zeromq/clrzmq2) library for binding to ⌀mq.

It is built in Visual Studio 2010 and targets the .NET 4 runtime.

The current status of the implementation can be found in the project wiki, as the output
